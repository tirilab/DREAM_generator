   ```bash
   $ python script.py -n [number of message data you want to generate] -f [file name of the synthetic messages] -tf [Taxonomy file name (in csv format)] -mf [Medicine list file name (in csv format)] -t [Taxonomy of the taxa3 as a string (optional: if you want to filter using taxa3 to generate messages of specific type)]
   ```

or use the command

   ```bash
   $ python script.py -h
   ```
for help on the flag usage.

## Data Samples
The taxonomy and medicine list files must be stored in assets folder.
A sample file for each is available in the assets folder.
