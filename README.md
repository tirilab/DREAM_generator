## OpenAI API Key

Please refer this [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/step-2-setup-your-api-key) to learn how to setup your OpenAI API Key.

After getting an API key use the command in the command line
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
```
and change the `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual API key.

## Run script

To generate message data, first replace the api_key in [script.py](https://github.com/tirilab/synthetic-patient-portal-message/blob/main/script.py). Then run the following comment under the project directory:

   ```bash
   $ python script.py -n [number of message data you want to generate] -f [file name of the synthetic messages] -tf [Taxonomy file name (in csv format)] -mf [Medicine list file name (in csv format)] -t [Taxonomy of the taxa3 as a string (optional: if you want to filter using taxa3 to generate messages of specific type)]
   ```

or use the command

   ```bash
   $ python script.py -h
   ```
for help on the flag usage.

## Data Samples
The taxonomy and medicine list files must be stored in assets folder.
A sample file for each is available in the assets folder.
